#Company Console Finance

##Description

This weeks challenge was to familairise with the basics in javascript, analyse a companies seven year net total, average and greatest month decrease and increase in profit.
The outcome had to be produced on console once the user has accsess to the html webpage. Bootcamp students also had to improve upon previous challenges to showcase their unique ability to progress with their newly learnt skills.

##Installation

When working on the project I came across an alternative method of inputting the data so that the output in console reflects something similar to the desired outcome. The code listed below would have arranged the data analysis at the very end of my console instead of between each element.
This is why I have chosen to show what that would've looked like in order to illustrate my ability to use javascript variables outside of a for loop command.

Variables outside a for loop:

file:///C:/Users/user/Downloads/Untitled%20document.pdf

var nettotal = 0 ;

for (var i=1; i<finances.length; i++){
  nettotal += finances[i][1];
}
console.log("Net Total"+ nettotal) ;

var month = finances.length;
var averagechange = nettotaltotal/month -1;

for (var i=1; i<finances.length; i++){
  averagechange += finances[i][1];
}

console.log("averagechange" + averagechange);

Variables inside a for loop:

##Usage

Github Link:

Download the starter code given on bootcamp spot.
Create a professional README file so that others can review yoru work and complete the challenge(to the best of their ability).
Create a repository for the project on Github, clone the repo if you need to.
Make sure the repo has a license and a README.txt
Click on 'settings' then 'pages' then on the Branch section select 'root' then save.
Click on the 'Action' icon on the top bar of the repository.
Deploy/Launch your project.
Follow the progress of your work this way, re-run the job until the final outcome is what you have created.
